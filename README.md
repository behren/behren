## Greetings from Germany, my name's Niclas! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Kubernetes, containerization, DevOps in general, Python, you get the idea.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Kubernetes and preparing for the CKAD certification.

### My recent projects

- [behren/100-days-of-code](https://github.com/behren/100-days-of-code) - A repository tracking my progress through @angelabauer's phenomenal Python bootcamp. Still progressing.
- [behren/MITx-6.00.1x](https://github.com/behren/MITx-6.00.1x) - A course provided by the MIT in collaboration with [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7), which I recently took and completed to gain more and solidify my Python knowledge.
